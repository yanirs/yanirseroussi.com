Read messages on the forum. Especially when joining a competition late, you can learn a lot from the problems other people had.

Even if you don’t know how to model something, knowing what you want to model is half of the solution. For example, in the DSG Hackathon (predicting air quality), we noticed that even though we had to produce hourly predictions for pollutant levels, the measured levels don’t change every hour (probably due to limitations in the measuring equipment). This led us to try a simple “model” for the first few hours, where we predicted exactly the last measured value, which proved to be one of our most valuable insights.

<p>Hi Yanir!</p>
<p>I have a question.</p>
<p>When you say: &ldquo;For example, minimising the mean absolute error (MAE) may require a different approach from minimising the mean square error (MSE).&rdquo; can you explain what kind of approach (or methods, or rules of thumb) that your get to minimising MAE or MSE in machine learning?</p>
<p>Thanks for your time in advance!</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Flavio</p>

<p>Hi Flavio!</p>
<p>The optimisation approach depends on the data and method you&rsquo;re using.</p>
<p>A basic example is when you don&rsquo;t have any features, only a sample of target values. In that case, if you want to minimise the MAE you should choose the sample median, and if you want to minimise the MSE you should choose the sample mean. Here&rsquo;s proof why: <a href=https://www.dropbox.com/s/b1195thcqebnxyn/mae-vs-rmse.pdf>https://www.dropbox.com/s/b1195thcqebnxyn/mae-vs-rmse.pdf</a></p>
<p>For more complex problems, if you&rsquo;re using a machine learning package you can often specify the type of loss function to minimise (see <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_function#Selecting_a_loss_function)>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_function#Selecting_a_loss_function)</a>. But even if your measure isn&rsquo;t directly optimised (e.g., MAE is harder to minimise than MSE because it&rsquo;s not differentiable at zero), you can always do cross-validation to find the parameters that optimise it.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>

<p>Hi Yanir!</p>
<p>appreciate your work! I need to know should I directly jump into machine learning algorithm, programming etc or to first master math and statistics ?
I am new in this field.</p>
