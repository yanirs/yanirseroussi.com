      **Welcome! üê≥Ô∏è** I'm Yanir Seroussi, a full-stack data scientist and software engineer with over a decade of
      experience. Concisely describing my work is a bit of a challenge, so [visit the About page for a longer intro
      and contact options](/about/).
      
      Over the years, I've published a bunch of posts on data science and other topics I find interesting. Scroll down
      to view them in reverse chronological order, or [explore posts by tag](/tags/).
      
      I mostly write to better understand specific topics and for future reference. My interests may change over time,
      but you can subscribe to my mailing list at [the bottom of any page](#mailing-list-email) for new post
      notifications.
      
      <p class="footnote">
        * Warning: Beware of self-proclaimed experts on the internet. Do your own due diligence.
