    content: |
      **Welcome! üê≥Ô∏è** I'm Yanir Seroussi, a full-stack data scientist and software engineer with over a decade of
      experience.
      
      These days, I provide independent consulting services around Data & AI, focusing on small-to-medium
      organisations in the climate tech and nature-positive sector. See [my consulting page](/consult/) for details,
      or [visit the about page for a longer intro and contact options](/about/).
      
      Over the years, I've published many posts on [data science](/tags/data-science/) and related topics. Scroll down
      to view them in reverse chronological order, or [explore posts by tag](/tags/). You can also check out the
      [Today I Learned (TIL)](/til/) section for posts that tend to be rougher and shorter.
      
      Subscribe to my mailing list at [the bottom of any page](#mailing-list-email) for new post notifications.
