          <h3>Q: Who are you? <a href="#/8" title="back to FAQ index">⤺</a></h3>
          <p class="small">
            A: I'm Yanir Seroussi. You can learn about my work history on
            <a href="https://yanirseroussi.com/about/" target="_blank">my About page</a>
            and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yanirseroussi/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.
            If you like credentials, I can tell you that I have a BSc in computer science and a PhD in applied AI from
            top universities.
            If you like name-dropping, I can tell you that I started my career in software engineering roles with Intel,
            Qualcomm, and Google. I became a full-stack data scientist in 2012, and have worked with multiple startups
            in Data &amp; AI leadership roles (e.g., as Head of Data Science at Car Next Door &ndash; now Uber
            Carshare). I also spent 4.5 years at Automattic building machine learning, analytics, and causal inference
            solutions that focused on increasing profits from the company's flagship product: WordPress.com.
          </p>
          <p class="small">
            In recent years, I've switched my full-time focus to work I consider to have a net-positive impact,
            especially around climate and biodiversity.
            This has included hands-on Data &amp; AI leadership work with Orkestra (a renewable energy startup), as well
            as with the Work on Climate and Reef Life Survey nonprofits.
          </p>
          <p class="small">
            The Fractional CDO offering is a way for me to help multiple positive-impact startups achieve their goals
            faster.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Q: Who are your ideal clients? <a href="#/8" title="back to FAQ index">⤺</a></h3>
          <p>
            A: Funded Australian positive-impact startups that don't have their own CDO.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you don't quite fit my ideal client rubric, e.g., if you're not in Australia or if you run a non-profit,
            please feel free to still get in touch.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your focus is on profit generation with little regard to negative externalities, it's unlikely to work
            out between us.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Q: What's up with all the text? <a href="#/8" title="back to FAQ index">⤺</a></h3>
          <p>
            A: You could say it's a test. I believe that robust async communication is key to modern remote-first
            startups. If your company is heavily reliant on meetings, it's unlikely to be a fit.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Q: What are your payment terms? <a href="#/8" title="back to FAQ index">⤺</a></h3>
          <p>
            A: Monthly in advance. If there's a fit, I'll invoice you for the first month.
            We'll start working together once payment is received.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Q: What if I want to cancel? <a href="#/8" title="back to FAQ index">⤺</a></h3>
          <p>
            A: You may cancel for a full refund within the first two weeks of our engagement.
          </p>
          <p>
            After that, you may cancel any time before the next billing period, and you won't be sent the next bill.
          </p>
          <p>
            This goes both ways: If things don't work out, I'll wrap up my work for the period you've been billed, and
            notify you of termination at least a week before the next billing period.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Q: Do you ever take time off? <a href="#/8" title="back to FAQ index">⤺</a></h3>
          <p>
            A: Yes, I do. I strive to communicate my availability well ahead of time.
            You won't be billed for periods when I'm unavailable.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Q: Can you help with a one-off strategy session? <a href="#/8" title="back to FAQ index">⤺</a></h3>
          <p>
            A: Maybe. Use <a href="https://forms.gle/ZhFTbkLFtsTPrZdk8" target="_blank">the booking form</a>,
            and include a note stating what you're after.
          </p>
