The way I got there was by first becoming a software engineer and then doing a PhD in what was essentially data science (before it became such a popular term). This post describes my first steps in the field with the goal of helping others who are interested in making the transition from pure software engineering to data science.\nWhile my first steps were in a PhD program, I don’t think that going through the formal PhD process is necessary if you wish to become a data scientist. Self-motivated individuals can get very far by making use of the abundance of learning resources available online. In fact, one can make progress much faster than in a PhD, because PhD programs have many overheads.\nThis post is organised as a list of steps. Despite the sequential numbering, many steps can be done in parallel. These steps roughly recount the work I’ve done to publish my first paper, which was co-authored by Ingrid Zukerman and Fabian Bohnert. Most of the technical details are intentionally omitted. Readers who are interested in learning more are invited to read the original paper or chapter 6 in my thesis, which includes more thorough experiments and explanations.\nStep one: Find a problem to work on Even if you know nothing about the machine learning and statistics side of data science, it’s important to find a problem to work on. Ideally it’d be something you find personally interesting, as this helps with motivation. You could use a predefined problem such as a Kaggle competition or one of the UCI datasets. Alternatively, you could collect the data yourself to make things a bit more challenging.\nIn my case, I was interested in natural language processing and user modelling. My supervisor was given a grant to work on sentiment analysis of opinion polls, which was my first direction of research. This quickly changed to focus on the connection between authors and the way they express their sentiments, with the application of harnessing this connection to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis algorithms. For the purpose of this research, I collected a dataset of texts by the most prolific IMDb users. The problem was to infer the ratings these users assigned to their own reviews, with the hypothesis that methods that take author identity into account would outperform methods that ignore authorship information.\nStep two: Close your knowledge gaps Whatever problem you choose, you will have some knowledge gaps that require filling. Wikipedia, textbooks, and online courses will be your best guide for foundational areas like machine learning and statistics. Reading academic papers is often required to get a better understanding of recent work on the specific problem you’re trying to solve.\nDoing a PhD afforded me the luxury of spending about a month just reading papers. Most of the ~200 papers I read were on sentiment analysis, which gave me a good overview of what’s been done in the field. However, the best thing I’ve done was to stop reading and move on to working on the problem. This is also the best advice I can give: there’s no better way to learn than getting your hands dirty working on a problem.\nStep three: Get your hands dirty With a well-defined problem and the knowledge gaps more-or-less closed, it is time to come up with a plan and implement it. Due to my background in software engineering and some exposure to early collaborative filtering approaches to recommender systems, my plan was very much a part of what Leo Breiman called the algorithmic modelling culture. That is, I was more focused on developing algorithms that work than on modelling the process that generated the data. This approach is arguably more in line with the mindset that software engineers tend to have than with the approach of mathematicians and statisticians.\nThe plan was quite simple:\nReproduce results that showed that rating inference models trained on enough texts by the target author (i.e., the author who wrote the text whose rating we want to predict) outperform models trained on texts by multiple authors Use an approach inspired by collaborative filtering to combine multiple single-author models to infer ratings for texts by the target author, where those models are weighted by similarity to the target author Experiment with multiple similarity measurements under various constraints on the number of texts available by the training and target authors Iterate on these ideas until the results are publishable The rationale behind this plan was that while different people express their sentiments differently, similar people would express their sentiments similarly (e.g., use of understatements varies by culture). The key motivation was Pang and Lee’s finding that a model trained on a single author is best if we have enough texts by this author.\nThe way I implemented the plan was vastly different from how I’d do it today. This was 2009, and using Java with the Weka package for the core modelling seemed like a huge improvement over the C/C++ I was used to. I relied heavily on the university grid to run experiments and wrote a bunch of code to handle experimental logic, including some Perl scripts for post-processing. It ended up being pretty messy, but it worked and I got publishable results. If I were to do the same work today, I’d use Python for everything. IPython Notebook is a great way of keeping track of experimental work, and Python packages like pandas, scikit-learn, gensim, TextBlob, etc. are mature and easy to use for data science applications.\nStep four: Publish your results Having a deadline for publishing results can be stressful, but it has two positive outcomes. First, making your work public allows you to obtain valuable feedback. Second, hard deadlines are great in making you work towards a tangible goal. You can always keep iterating to get infinitesimal improvements, but publication deadlines force you to decide that you’ve done enough.\nIn my case, the deadline for the UMAP 2010 conference and the promise of a free trip to Hawaii served as excellent motivators. But even if you don’t have the time or energy to get an academic paper published, you should set yourself a deadline to publish something on a blog or a forum, or even as a report to a mentor who can assess your work. Receiving continuous feedback is a key factor in improvement, so release early and release often.\nStep five: Improve results or move on Congratulations! You have published the results of your study. What now? You can either keep working on the same problem – try more approaches, add more data, change the constraints, etc. Or you can move on to work on other problems that interest you.\nIn my case, I had to go back to iterate on the results of the first paper because of things I learned later. I ended up rerunning all the experiments to make things fit together into a more-or-less coherent story for the thesis (writing a thesis is one of the main overheads that comes with doing a PhD). If I had a choice, I wouldn’t have done that. I would instead have pursued more sensible enhancements to the work presented in the paper, such as using the author as a feature, employing more robust ensemble methods, and testing different base methods than support vector machines. Nonetheless, I still think that the core idea – that the identity of authors should be taken into account in sentiment analysis – is still relevant and viable today. But I’ve taken my own advice and moved on.\n","wordCount":"1274","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://yanirseroussi.com/2015/05/02/first-steps-in-data-science-author-aware-sentiment-analysis/kitten-first-steps.jpg","datePublished":"2015-05-02T08:31:10Z","dateModified":"2024-01-16T09:56:03+10:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Yanir Seroussi"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://yanirseroussi.com/2015/05/02/first-steps-in-data-science-author-aware-sentiment-analysis/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Yanir Seroussi | Data \u0026 AI for Startup Impact","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://yanirseroussi.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://yanirseroussi.com/ accesskey=h title="Yanir Seroussi | Data & AI for Startup Impact (Alt + H)">Yanir Seroussi | Data & AI for Startup Impact</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)">

I’m still fascinated by the lure to extract sentiment from text, but it seems like so often the sentiment that the author intended never fully came to expression in the text. Maybe an interdisciplinary approach will be required to teach machines to parse the intentions implicit in text, and, like other media phenomena, a loop will have to form: perhaps the awareness that explicit intentions and sentiment are of benefit to authors in a world that (one day) automates the sorting of all its documents will cause writing styles to adapt. The effect of the best we can on what we’re doing now is one of those things you begin to see a pattern in. Here&rsquo;s an API that correlates patterns of unstructured info: dev.keywordmeme.com Would love your feedback. Let me know if it’s useful to you or if you have any comments. Well done on the carbon post, btw.

I agree that analysing sentiment is very tricky due to the fact that people often don&rsquo;t express themselves so well. If I remember correctly, inter-annotator agreement on some sentiment analysis tasks is only 70-80%, so it&rsquo;s likely that we will ever have perfect performance by machines.</p><p>dev.keywordmeme.com redirects to a github page &ndash; where is the API?</p></div></div><div class=comment-level-2 id=comment-395><div class=comment-header><a href=#comment-395><img class=comment-avatar src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/600eae285b7bf6c93fca8c0bf155589c?s=50"><p class=comment-info><strong>Robert Klein (@PaperbackLegacy)</strong><br><small>2015-05-26 19:43:10</small></p></a></div><div class="comment-body post-content">You bet. I&rsquo;m fascinated to see what seems to be a real live push toward an interdisciplinary approach. That 70-80% performance might be pushed over the hump by humans with special training until such a time as the process can be formalized. It looks like auditing ML-driven processes could be a new category of employment through this next technological plateau. The human-machine relationship in a friendly old configuration!
Sorry about the link. This should work: <a href=http://www.keywordmeme.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>http://www.keywordmeme.com/</a>. It makes you register, just a heads up. Hit the engineers up on github if you have any questions or if things aren&rsquo;t working. Which is possible.

Good places to start would be your current workplace (if you work with data scientists), or local meetups (if there are any in your area). Another option would be to contribute to open source projects in the field as a way of getting to know people and getting feedback. Finally, there are courses like <a href=https://www.thinkful.com/courses/learn-data-science-online/ target=_blank rel=nofollow>the one by Thinkful</a>, where you can pay to be mentored.</p><p>Regarding getting published, I agree that it&rsquo;d be hard to get published in many academic venues without help from people who know how it&rsquo;s done. However, you can always start your own blog and link to it from places like Reddit and DataTau. Even if you don&rsquo;t get any feedback, publishing often forces you to think more deeply about the subject of your article.</p></div></div><div class=comment-level-2 id=comment-639><div class=comment-header><a href=#comment-639><img class=comment-avatar src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8830e28e12d6e04e41e17809bf7eb644?s=50"><p class=comment-info><strong>Amine</strong><br><small>2015-09-04 11:18:10</small></p></a></div><div class="comment-body post-content"><p>At the workplace, it will be a bit hard.</p><p>I Live in Paris, meetups would be a good option.</p><p>You&rsquo;re right, publishing forces to think more deeply, feedbacks from readers are also good way to learn.</p></div></div></section><p class="post-content data-webring">This site is a part of the <a href=https://randyau.github.io/datawebring/index.html target=_blank rel=noopener>Data People Writing Stuff</a> webring.<br><a class=data-webring-previous-link target=_blank rel=noopener>← previous site</a>
