Iteratively implementing pragmatic solutions. Saying what I‚Äôll do, doing what I said, and communicating if anything changes. To ensure the best results, I say no to engagements where there isn‚Äôt a great fit. In such cases, I may connect you to someone from my network who is better placed to help you.\nInterested in working together?

He is the single most talented person I‚Äôve had the opportunity to work with in my nearly 15 years in Data/ML.\nHe‚Äôs an excellent engineer, a curious data scientist, an authoritative ML expert, and a confident \u0026 clear communicator. Yanir‚Äôs work isn‚Äôt driven by ego. He experiments with new tech but never gets distracted by the latest shiny objects. Instead, he‚Äôs dedicated to doing things the right way and choosing the right tools for the job, whether that‚Äôs a neural network-based time series regressor or a simple VLOOKUP.\nDemet Dagdelen, Director of ML and Experimentation at Automattic (WordPress.com) Bio and mission With over a decade of experience across various data and engineering roles, the main theme of my career has been bringing data-intensive applications to production. This has included anything from solving isolated data problems to building systems that serve millions of users. With a proven capability to work independently and in teams, lead and mentor colleagues, and communicate with both technical and non-technical stakeholders, my focus is always on delivering business value.\nMy experience and formal education fall under three key areas:\nsoftware engineering (15+ years; Computer Science BSc) data science / engineering (10+ years; Artificial Intelligence PhD) tech leadership (5+ years with startups and scaleups) üê≥\nMy current mission is to help climate and nature tech startups grow and scale successfully with Data/AI/ML.\nüê≥ Interested in working together? Book a free intro call or contact me to discuss.\nIn addition to volunteering with Reef Life Survey for nearly a decade, Yanir has initiated and led several paid projects to build and maintain public-facing tools on the Reef Life Survey website. These tools are phenomenal and have significantly improved volunteer training, field work, funding agency partnerships, reputation, and public engagement and knowledge. Yanir‚Äôs proactivity, creativity and high quality of work have been invaluable to our organisation. I strongly recommend Yanir to anyone looking to implement data \u0026 AI projects.\nRick Stuart-Smith, President at Reef Life Survey There are a lot of data scientists in the world today. They range from advanced analysts to experienced mathematicians. Yanir sits at a unique nexus: he has a strong academic background with sound mathematical and statistical skills, he can build solutions end to end, and he has a relentless thirst for the truth. I‚Äôd recommend Yanir any day if you are looking for someone who can execute thoughtfully and leave no stone unturned. You can trust Yanir‚Äôs outputs in a world where it is very easy to accidentally (or due to laziness) let the data lie to those who need it most.\nLastly, Yanir is passionate and I‚Äôve had direct experience that he will see a conversation through no matter the degree of disagreement. He‚Äôs the kind of person you want to disagree with because you know you‚Äôll get the best outcome or agree to disagree and feel like you are still on a team together. In my opinion, this working style is my favorite brand of loyalty ‚Äì the ability to hash it out, find the truth, build solutions to move the business forward.\nJennifer Wilson, Associate Principal at Google; formerly Director of Data \u0026 Analytics at Automattic (WordPress.com) ","wordCount":"974","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://yanirseroussi.com/yanir-seroussi-startup-data-and-ai-consultant-banner.webp","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2024-06-26T15:02:31+10:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Yanir Seroussi"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://yanirseroussi.com/consult/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Yanir Seroussi | Data \u0026 AI for Startup Impact","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://yanirseroussi.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://yanirseroussi.com/ accesskey=h title="Yanir Seroussi | Data & AI for Startup Impact (Alt + H)">Yanir Seroussi | Data & AI for Startup Impact</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><button id=menu-trigger aria-haspopup=menu aria-label="Menu Button"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-menu"><line x1="3" y1="12" x2="21" y2="12"/><line x1="3" y1="6" x2="21" y2="6"/><line x1="3" y1="18" x2="21" y2="18"/></svg></button><ul class="menu hidden"><li><a href=https://yanirseroussi.com/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li><li><a href=https://yanirseroussi.com/posts/ title=Posts><span>Posts</span></a></li><li><a href=https://yanirseroussi.com/talks/ title=Talks><span>Talks</span></a></li><li><a href=https://yanirseroussi.com/consult/ title=Consulting><span class=active>Consulting</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Helping climate & nature tech startups ship data-intensive solutions</h1><div class=post-meta></div></header><figure class=entry-cover><img loading=eager src=https://yanirseroussi.com/yanir-seroussi-startup-data-and-ai-consultant-banner.webp alt="Logo of Yanir Seroussi's consulting services, depicting a wave and an up-and-to-the-right graph next to his profile picture."></figure><div class=post-content><p>This is a high-level overview of the sort of problems I help with and how you can engage with me.
