body: Ah, thanks, that clarifies what you meant. The (currently still running) Africa
  Soil Property contest (https://www.kaggle.com/c/afsis-soil-properties) seems a bit
  similar. I won't put much more energy into that contest, but I am curious how it
  will work out in the end, and what things will have worked for the winners (maybe
  not much except pure luck).
