body: Thanks for the quick response!  I think I'll be using Sublime Text on EC2 with
  S3 in the short term, and possibly move onto Amazon ML with RedShift in the future.  I'll
  probably take snapshots by outputting results to the console or MatPlotLib every
  once in awhile, so that's great advice as well.
