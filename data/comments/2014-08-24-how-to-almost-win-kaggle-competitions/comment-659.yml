body: 'I''m starting to dive into Kaggle competitions right now, and I''m having trouble
  with some of the simple practical considerations.  For example, what IDE should
  I be using - IPython Notebooks?  Where should I store the data?  My personal computer
  surely doesn''t have 50GB+ space to spare.   How long should I wait for a script
  to run before I deem it as "broken"?


  Any advice here would be greatly appreciated!'
