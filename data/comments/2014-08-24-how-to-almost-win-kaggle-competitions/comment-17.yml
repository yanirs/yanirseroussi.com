body: Can you elaborate what you mean in Tip 5 by stating "The main scenarios when
  you should skip local validation is when the data is too small ...". What I experienced
  is that with too little observations, the leaderboard becomes very misleading, so
  my intuition would be to use more local validation for small datasets, not less.
