body: 'Thanks for your comment, Derek. These are all good questions, but the answers
  really depend on the problem you''re working on and what you''re comfortable with.


  Personally, I find IPython Notebooks useful for playing around with the data and
  for documenting/storing throwaway code. However, once you have code that is more
  complex or code that you want to rerun, it''s better to save it in separate files.
  For editing these files, I use PyCharm.


  Not all problems require a large hard drive. If you are working on a large dataset,
  you can either purchase an external drive, or hire an instance from a cloud provider
  like AWS or <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=cd96cae9d5e1" target="_blank"
  rel="nofollow">DigitalOcean</a>. The latter is generally cheaper than AWS, but they
  don''t offer GPUs. If you are working with a remote server, you can run IPython
  Notebook on the server and work from your browser.


  Regarding waiting for a script, for many models you can first build a simple version
  to test that everything works (e.g., build a random forest with just a few trees
  or train a neural network for a few iterations). If everything works well, you can
  run the full version. If the run time is long, it''s a good idea to take snapshots
  of the model and monitor performance on a hold-out set to ensure that you''re not
  wasting time overfitting.'
