  \ each of the 204 writers had only two training paragraphs (all containing the same\
  \ text), while the test/leaderboard instances were a third paragraph with different\
  \ content. I tried many forms of local validation but none of them yielded results\
  \ that were consistent with the leaderboard, so I ended up relying on the leaderboard\
  \ score."
