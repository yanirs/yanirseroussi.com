body: 'Thanks for the Bandcamp Recommender, showed me some interesting music ! Have
  one question though, maybe i am knocking atthe wrong door here.. , but when accessing
  ''my'' bandcamp on the I-Phone, there''s no more log-in plus very nice elevator
  going up tune, and direct access to ''my'' music, also the log-out option is gone...
  Or am I doing something wrong.. or where can I ask for this..?

  Thank you, and all the best'
