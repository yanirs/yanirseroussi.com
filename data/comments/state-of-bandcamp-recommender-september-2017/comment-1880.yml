  surprised to hear that Bandcamp Recommender was your project.

  i am bandcamp freak... Bandcamp has recently strarted recommendations at the bottom
  ;-) seems primitive though.  example https://ogreyouasshole.bandcamp.com/album/crossword-lost-sigh-days-james-mcnew-remixes

  would love to hear about the basic logic you used behind the "recommendations"  .
  I have no technical knowledge at all but a few years ago thought of a basic recommendation
  model ..but couldnt take it forward though...i thought ''contextualizing'' artists
  would be a cool way to connect bands.

  cheers.!'
