    Reading of the despair of the many silent/invisible contributors of intellectual property copied, without financial recompense, which went into these LLMs. It's a training data gold rush/free for all right now, just as unedifying and thoughtless as actual gold rushes in history were. I fear this will also quickly lead to Apple-style closed gardens of proprietary creative talent (think of top artists, writers and thinkers signed up to train AI rather than creating content for direct human consumption). Counter-ML tech like Glaze will only delay the inevitable. https://glaze.cs.uchicago.edu/.
    
    I can think of some ways where governments might respond, e.g. special taxes and incentives on AI businesses to fund creative academies and collectives, much as public universities are today.
