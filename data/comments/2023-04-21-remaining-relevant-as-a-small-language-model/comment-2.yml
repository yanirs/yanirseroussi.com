  Thanks John! Yeah, I doubt that tech like Glaze can be made future proof, as they admit on that page. Besides, I lean more towards the view that [all creative work is derivative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcvd5JZkUXY) and [copying isn't theft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeTybKL1pM4). Copyright mostly protects platforms and businesses rather than individuals. While I empathise with individuals who feel like their work is being exploited without their permission, I don't see the training of machine learning models as being that different from artists learning from other artists.
  
  Thoughtful government intervention would be great, but it's unlikely to be applied in a timely manner or evenly across jurisdictions.
