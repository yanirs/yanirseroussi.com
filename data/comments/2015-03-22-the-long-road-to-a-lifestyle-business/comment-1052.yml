body: That's very true. The interesting thing is that it's a problem that is not unique
  to this century. It was discussed by Thoreau in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walden"
  target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Walden</a> (1854), Bertrand Russell in <a href="http://www.zpub.com/notes/idle.html"
  target="_blank" rel="nofollow">In Praise of Idleness</a> (1932), and David Graeber
  in <a href="http://strikemag.org/bullshit-jobs/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">On
  the Phenomenon of Bullshit Jobs</a> (2013), to name a few. People seem to be worried
  about robots taking their jobs, but the scarier thought is that robots will never
  take our jobs, because we'll keep coming up with ways of staying employed rather
  than enjoy the affluence afforded by technological advancements.
