body: '"What I really wanted was a stable part-time gig.": They''re remarkably hard
  to find. It''s an absurdity of our time that many people are overemployed - selling
  more of their time than they want for more money than they need - even while many
  other people are underemployed - unable to sell enough of their time for enough
  money to live comfortably.'
