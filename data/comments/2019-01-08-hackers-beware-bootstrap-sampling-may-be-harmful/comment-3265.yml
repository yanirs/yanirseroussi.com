body: Learned a lot from the post. One question on the CIs for means and the difference
  between the means. If the two CIs for the means do not overlap, does it always imply
  that the difference is significant? Or can the error go in both ways, meaning that
  it is possible to have non-overlapping CIs and the CI of the difference includes
  0?
