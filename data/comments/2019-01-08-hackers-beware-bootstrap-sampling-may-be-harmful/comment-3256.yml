body: "\"the basic bootstrap makes no assumption about the underlying distribution\
  \ of the data\": I suppose bootstrapping per se doesn't, but some things people\
  \ like to use it for do. For example, suppose the original sample is from a Cauchy\
  \ distribution, and bootstrapping is used to compute a confidence interval around\
  \ the sample mean; no matter how many bootstrap replicates are used, the computed\
  \ interval is worthless, because the original distribution doesn't have a mean.\
  \ Of course, that's an extreme case unlikely to arise in practice, but it immediately\
  \ raises doubt that guidelines like \"n \u2265 101 for the bootstrap t\" should\
  \ be applied uncritically. As you obviously agree, it's best to know and think about\
  \ where the data came from when deciding which statistical methods to apply."
