  I generally agree that it can be beneficial to involve data scientists early on
  and to avoid thoughtless heuristics, but that it all depends on having a supportive
  data-driven environment and on resource constraints. As mentioned under Q2, getting
  advice from a data scientist in the early stages of the product is worthwhile, so
  it may be smart to pay for a few days of consulting, but not necessarily a good
  idea to hire a full-timer. A lot of it depends on the general product vision.


  Another note regarding heuristics and intuition: While some may be dangerous, you
  can view many modelling decisions as heuristics. For example, when building a predictive
  model, you have to make some intuition-driven choices around features (no model
  uses all the knowledge in the world), learning algorithms and their hyperparameters.
  You just can''t test everything, so there''s a need for compromises if you aim to
  ever deliver anything.'
