body: 'Finding a mentor depends on where you are. Good places to start would be your
  current workplace (if you work with data scientists), or local meetups (if there
  are any in your area). Another option would be to contribute to open source projects
  in the field as a way of getting to know people and getting feedback. Finally, there
  are courses like <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/courses/learn-data-science-online/"

  mentored.


  Regarding getting published, I agree that it''d be hard to get published in many
  academic venues without help from people who know how it''s done. However, you can
  always start your own blog and link to it from places like Reddit and DataTau. Even
  if you don''t get any feedback, publishing often forces you to think more deeply
  about the subject of your article.'
