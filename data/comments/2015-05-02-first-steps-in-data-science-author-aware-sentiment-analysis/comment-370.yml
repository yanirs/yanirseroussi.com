body: "Thanks for the stimulation. I\u2019m still fascinated by the lure to extract\
  \ sentiment from text, but it seems like so often the sentiment that the author\
  \ intended never fully came to expression in the text. Maybe an interdisciplinary\
  \ approach will be required to teach machines to parse the intentions implicit in\
  \ text, and, like other media phenomena, a loop will have to form: perhaps the awareness\
  \ that explicit intentions and sentiment are of benefit to authors in a world that\
  \ (one day) automates the sorting of all its documents will cause writing styles\
  \ to adapt. The effect of the best we can on what we\u2019re doing now is one of\
  \ those things you begin to see a pattern in. Here's an API that correlates patterns\
  \ of unstructured info: dev.keywordmeme.com Would love your feedback. Let me know\
  \ if it\u2019s useful to you or if you have any comments. Well done on the carbon\
  \ post, btw. Glad I found your blog."
