  Thank you very much for this post. Helpul for somebody like me seeking to be a data
  scientist.


  I''m a software engineer, currently master data architect.


  I''m taking MOOCs in order to fill the gaps, so let''s say I''m on a good track
  :)


  However, once problem found and hands got dirty, how to find a mentor ? afterwards,
  get published ?


  I think this would be hard via academic'
