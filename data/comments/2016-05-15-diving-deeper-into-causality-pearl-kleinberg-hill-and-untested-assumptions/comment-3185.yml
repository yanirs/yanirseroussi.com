body: 'Great post. I did not know about Kleinberg and Hill''s work. I knew a similar
  list of criteria from this article, which is much younger https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0951629805050859

  Regarding Kleinberg: Adding time certainly is valuable, but doesn''t the smoking
  example change the research question from whether smoking causes lung cancer to
  when it causes lung cancer? The latter question is more informative and implies
  the former, but I''d say it is fine to ask the first question when one is not interested
  in the time of occurrence of cancer.'
