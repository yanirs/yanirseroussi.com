body: "Interesting point on the causal significance. How does this work when you have\
  \ confounders in x? I'd have thought that x must contain the set of prima facie\
  \ causes *for which we have true exogenous variation*. \n\nAlso, how does it work\
  \ when you have bad controls in x (where x includes post-treatment causes that are\
  \ plausibly varied by c)?"
