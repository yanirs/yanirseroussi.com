body: 'How did you arrive at the conclusion that accuracy doesn''t matter? The Netflix
  quote and chart don''t seem connected to me. The quote refers to the massive ensembling
  used to achieve the challenge score threshold. The chart seems to show that you
  can go a long way from the baseline by improving features and models.


  I''d say accuracy, or more generally, score used for evaluation, doesn''t matter
  _as long as it''s good enough_. However, it''s not that easy to arrive at "good
  enough". Consider Spotify. I find their daily recommendations abysmal. Discover
  Weekly is much better, but still has room to improve.'
