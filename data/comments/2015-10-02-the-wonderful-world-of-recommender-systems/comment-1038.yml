body: 'It is important, but its importance tends to be exaggerated to the exclusion
  of all other metrics. As I said in the post, things like the way you present your
  results (UI/UX) and novelty/serendipity are also very important. In addition, the
  goal of the system is often to optimise a different goal from offline accuracy,
  such as revenue or engagement. In such cases it is best to focus on what you want
  to improve rather than offline accuracy.


  By the way, I attended a talk by Ted Dunning a few months ago, where he said that
  one of the most important tweaks in real-life recommender system is adding random
  recommendations (essentially decreasing offline accuracy). This allows the system
  to learn from user feedback on a wider range of items, improving performance in
  the long run.'
