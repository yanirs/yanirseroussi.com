body: 'I agree. I said that predictive accuracy has some importance, but it is not
  the only thing that matters. You''re right about it needing to be <em>good enough</em>,
  where the definition of good enough is domain-dependent.

  target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Daniel Lopresti</a> said it well years ago (he spoke
  about web search but it applies to recommendation scenarios where suggestions are
  browsable):

  <blockquote>

  Browsing is a comfortable and powerful paradigm (the serendipity effect). Search
  results don''t have to be very good.

  Recall? Not important (as long as you get at least some good hits).

  Precision? Not important (as long as at least some of the hits on the first page
  you return are good).
