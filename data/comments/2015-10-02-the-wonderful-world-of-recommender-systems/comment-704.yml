body: 'Two points that were not discussed but I see it recurrently, at least in E-Commerce,
  it is how people underestimate the effort necessary to build an online realtime
  recommender system and overestimate its impact. Offline recommendations are enough
  for the majority of cases. The second one, there is an obsession with novel algorithms,
  when often bread and butter ALS + domain knowledge reflected in business rules bring
  better impact.


  Overall, really good overview, and I fully agree with all points!'
