  Many years ago, I terribly overfit a model which caused losses of a lot of shekels
  (a LOT). It''s not that I wasn''t aware of the potential overfitting. I was. Among
  other things, I used several bootstrapping simulations. It turns out that I applied
  the bootstrapping in a wrong way. My particular problem was that I "forgot" about
  confounding parameters and that I "forgot" that peeping into the future is a bad
  thing.


  Anyhow, Yanir Seroussi, my coworker data scientist, gave a very good talk on bootstrapping.'
