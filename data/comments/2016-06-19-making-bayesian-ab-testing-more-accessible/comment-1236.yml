body: My hunch is that the % of HDI chosen is of less interest to a user than seeing
  how each test iteration alters the HDI and shifts the level of overlap between HDI
  and ROPE toward one of either outcome. In the example given above, would a fair
  interpretation be that the differences appear weighted more toward the negative
  than the positive? With precision, shouldn't it be made a function of the minimum
  effect requested? Larger ROPE require less precision and vice versa?
