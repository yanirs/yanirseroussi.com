body: "Thanks for the post!  \n\nI'm more of a business stakeholder simply trying\
  \ to improve our testing practices, rather than a data scientist who understands\
  \ the theories at a detailed level. \n\nI'm a bit confused why, if I enter the default\
  \ example in your calculator (5000 trials each, 100 successes vs 130), the recommendation\
  \ is to implement EITHER variant. \n\nWhereas, using a tool such as the following\
  \ suggests a 97.8% chance the variant with 130 successes will outperform the control:\
  \  https://abtestguide.com/bayesian/\n\nThis calculator also seems to suggest the\
  \ 130 successes variant should be chosen, not EITHER, as there is 95% confidence\
  \ the result is not due to chance : https://abtestguide.com/calc/\n\n\nA secondary\
  \ question is, if there is no predetermined sample size with the Bayesian approach,\
  \ how do you plan how long to run the test for?  Mainly to deal with stakeholder\
  \ communication &amp; project planning, but also to avoid peaking. \n\nMany thanks,\n\
