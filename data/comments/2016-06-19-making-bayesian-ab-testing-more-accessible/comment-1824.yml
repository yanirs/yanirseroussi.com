body: Thanks for the clarification, Georgi. You're right, the calculator doesn't take
  the number of peeks into account. As noted in the final paragraph of the post, I
  don't think it matters as much as other factors, so I'm not planning on changing
  this. As discussed in <a href="https://yanirseroussi.com/2016/05/15/diving-deeper-into-causality-pearl-kleinberg-hill-and-untested-assumptions/">a
  separate post</a>, statistical significance doesn't imply causality, which is what
  we really care about. It is just one factor that should be taken into account when
  deciding to implement changes.
