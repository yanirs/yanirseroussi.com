body: Thanks for your comment, John! I think that it appears weighted more towards
  the negative because the beta distribution is symmetric when the mean is 0.5 (alpha
  = beta), and asymmetric in other cases, making it less pointy. According to Kruschke's
  simulations, using the precision stopping rule makes the success rate estimate closer
  to the true mean of the underlying distribution than with other stopping rules,
  which tend to overestimate the success rate. I'm not sure we'd get the same results
  if precision were a function of the minimum effect, but I'd like to run more simulations
  to get a better feeling for how it works.
