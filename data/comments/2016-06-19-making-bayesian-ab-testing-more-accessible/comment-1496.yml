  There are many approaches to Bayesian A/B testing. It looks like the other one you
  linked to doesn''t allow you to specify your prior knowledge about the conversion
  rate and the decision criterion. Which values did you use for those fields in my
  calculator?


  As mentioned in the last paragraph of the post, you should really aim for a representative
  sample of users -- size is only one factor. That being said, you can play with the
  number of trials in the calculator to get an idea of the required sample size based
  on the minimum effect criterion.'
