  I''ve read the explanation provided, and it left me feeling like the calculator
  ignores the stopping rule used up to the point when data enters your calculator.
  The same is confirmed by the calculator interface, where I see no option to specify
  a stopping rule or number and points of prior observations I''ve done on the data
  I enter. While for the first part one can assume that the user would use your calculator
  for each look and the stopping rule is then given and the same, the second part
  clearly means it will have no input on the number and timing of peeks. Given that
  the stopping rule is data-based, it is certain to introduce heavy bias on the resulting
  statistics, if my impression that you''re not adjusting the calculations to account
  for peeking/optional stopping in any way are correct. Am I wrong in my assertion?


  Thanks,

  Georgi'
