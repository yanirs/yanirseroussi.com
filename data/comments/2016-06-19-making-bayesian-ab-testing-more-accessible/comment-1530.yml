  That''s correct. If you set the minimum effect field to 0.5, it means that changes
  in the success rate that are lower than 0.5% are considered equivalent to zero change.
  In your example, if the success rate changes from 5% to anything between 4.5% and
  5.5%, the change is considered to be insubstantial or unimportant. Note that this
  is different from statistical significance: A change is significant in the statistical
  sense if it is unlikely to be due to random variation. The decision whether a change
  is substantial or important depends on your application, which is where the minimum
  effect threshold comes in.'
