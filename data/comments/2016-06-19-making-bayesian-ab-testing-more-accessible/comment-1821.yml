body: Thanks Georgi. I'm not sure I understand your question. The stopping rule is
  explained under "Building the new calculator". It's worth reading Kruschke's articles
  for further explanations. Also, as noted in the final paragraph of the post, no
  stopping rule can tell you whether your sample is representative of the general
  population, so results on synthetic data are of limited use.
