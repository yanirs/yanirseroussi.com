body: 'Yanir hi! Thanks for sharing this content. I got a question regarding something
  said on the Lyst blog post that I havent seen mentioned here: "Both of these problems
  (repeated testing and low base rate) are much less pronounced when we use an informative
  prior." Could you please explain how and why this occurs? Or share some paper about
  it? Because otherwise I cant see in which ways prior selection affects type 1 errors
  (since you are comparing it to the problems of repeated testing). And also, as my
  understanding goes, bayesian inference does not control for type 1 errors, its not
  in its interest to do so, so why would someone choose a prior conditioned on its
  possible effects on type 1 errors?'
