body: 'I''m not entirely sure about statements by the Lyst post authors, but I think

  positives. However, this is also addressed by using a stopping rule like Krushcke''s.


  By the way, Kruschke''s 2018 paper <a href="https://osf.io/s5vdy/" rel="nofollow
  ugc">Rejecting or accepting parameter values in Bayesian estimation</a> is a good
  recent read on the topic.'
