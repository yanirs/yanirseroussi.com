  The calculator is simple enough, and easy to use, though it lacks some basic things
  such as testing more than one variant against a control, which is very often done
  in practice.


  I, and hopefully others, am interested to learn how information about the stopping
  rule used enters into the calculations, if at all? After all, ignoring the stopping
  rule would be like discarding data that can have a critical impact on the decision
  made. I make an argument about it here: http://blog.analytics-toolkit.com/2017/bayesian-ab-testing-not-immune-to-optional-stopping-issues/
  , with lots of references. Another take on the issue I''ve recently found is here
  http://srmart.in/bayes-optional-stopping/ .


  Best,

  Georgi'
