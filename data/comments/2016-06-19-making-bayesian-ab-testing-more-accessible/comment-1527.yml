  I agree that Peak Conversion makes it easy, but not being able to change the priors
  makes it limited.  Lyst is a very good tool but your use of "success rate" rather
  than specifying an alpha and beta makes it much more intuitive.


  I just wanted to confirm my assumption on the "Minimum effect" field - you said
  it''s absolute, so if I wanted to detect a 10% difference in a 5% success rate,
  that means I would have to input the value as 0.5?'
