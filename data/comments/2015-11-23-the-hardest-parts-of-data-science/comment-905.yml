body: 'Yes, many good points here, thanks for this. There is even another difficulty
  apart from problem definition and solution measurement:  the semantics of the data
  itself.  Are the definitions real (referring to other concepts) or nominal ("a cheeseburger
  is a burger with cheese")? Scope and context can easily be lost,  and can only be
  put back by a human being taking a decision, no amount of empirical modelling can
  re-discover this. Also precision and accuracy of the data may be unknown and/or
  insufficient to solve the problem posed.  If you have detected these issues, sometimes
  you can re-formulate the problem,but typically its not clear from the column headings
  alone (if you even have these). Even worse, the definitions may be incoherent or
  nonsensical: eg in classical econometric modelling the definition of a rational
  agent entails that the agent have knowledge of the future!'
