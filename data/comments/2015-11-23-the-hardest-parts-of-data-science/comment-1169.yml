body: Thank you Yansir! I found this post extremely enlightening. I was starting to
  question to what extent the value of a data scientist would be affected by the emergence
  of automated data cleaning and model building tools. It makes far more sense that
  the true value of the role is in the experimental design as opposed to applying
  algorithms.
