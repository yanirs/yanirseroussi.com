  The word "sophistry" keeps leaping to mind. E.g.:


  &gt; For instance, if a government embarks on the building of a pyramid [...]

  s/"a government"/Paris/g

  s/pyramid/"Eiffel Tower"/g

  How persuasive is Shostak now? Let''s just ignore that, generally speaking, pyramids
  were for the glorification of a ruling class which elicited _no guidance_ fr its
  populus.


  &gt; [...]  no matter how much data you have, you still depend on your intuition
  for deciding how to interpret and then apply the data.

  No, I draw *conclusions from the data*, ponder the evidence, challenge the null
  hypothesis &amp; take a reasoned position based on best available evidence, accordingly.
  Mere superstitious nonsense has no part of it. Has Berkun ever heard of the tautology
  fallacy? Hume''s Fork? ISO/ANSI? I do so detest the implied anti-intellectualism
  of that block quote.'
