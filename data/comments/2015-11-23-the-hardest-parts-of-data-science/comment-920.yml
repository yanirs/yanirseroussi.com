  I don''t think that replacing "a government" with Paris and pyramid with "Eiffel
  Tower" makes Shostak''s argument any less convincing. The point still stands that
  the GDP measure is flawed because it can easily be manipulated through activities
  that don''t contribute positively to society. Do you think that GDP growth is worth
  focusing on?


  As to the Berkun quote, I suggest you read more of his writings before dismissing
  it. He is anything but superstitious and an anti-intellectual. Drawing conclusions
  from data, pondering the evidence, challenging the null hypothesis, and taking a
  reasoned position based on the best available evidence doesn''t contradict depending
  on your intuition for deciding how to interpret and then apply the data. Intuition
  is often based on experience and data that hasn''t been formally captured. For example,
  in Bayesian modelling you''re free to use your intuition when setting priors, but
  the weight of these priors becomes smaller as evidence accumulates.'
