  probably all guilty of doing any number of those mistakes at one point or another
  of our careers. And it wouldn''t surprise me that a lot of companies are doing all
  of those mistakes at the same time. I especially liked #6. Instead of stupidity,
  I would suggest that that ego is responsible for it.'
