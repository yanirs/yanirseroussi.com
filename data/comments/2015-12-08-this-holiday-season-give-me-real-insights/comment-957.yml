body: 'Nice post. Mostly agree. Automated insights are hard to automate though, but
  we (the WordPress.com Data Team) are working on it.


  Some of the things we''ve found that have the biggest impact on successful blogging
  are:

  - Turning on publicize so your posts are pushed out to various social media channels

  - Regularly publishing. Doesn''t have to be daily, but does need to be regular.
  We still don''t understand how the periodicity plays into this.

  - Images in posts are correlated with more traffic.


  There''s still a lot to learn here. Interested in helping? https://automattic.com/work-with-us/data-wrangler/
