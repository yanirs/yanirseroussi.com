body: 'Thanks Greg! All those factors make sense. Personally, I prefer sharing posts
  manually to turning on Publicize, but I suppose it has the same effect. My guess
  is that one of the reasons why images are important is that having at least one
  image makes posts stick out when shared on social media.


  By the way, I did apply for the data wrangler position a couple of months ago but
  never heard back. It''s probably too late now, as I have a different position (and
  a few other options) lined up when I get home from vacation next month :)'
