  The post really reasonated with me.

  I find more and more that I do engineering during my day than science.


  I believe the data engineering part, including cloud and full stack development
  skills, will prove to be the skills that keep you relevant in industry. If you combine
  these with knowledge on which techniques to use regarding data science and machine
  learning, then you can be unstoppable.


  Otherwise, as you said, it''s better to stay in academia.


  Best,

  Antonios'
