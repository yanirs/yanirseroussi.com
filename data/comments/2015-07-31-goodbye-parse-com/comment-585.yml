  \ it's been working great for us so far. I actually think we still have one of the\
  \ prototypes running over it which we haven't touched in almost year (a mobile/web\
  \ strategy game now only available on FB - https://apps.facebook.com/foresttribes/).\
  \ It's been great since it also saved us the need to develop a backend admin tool\
  \ to manage/balance the game or add additional content.\n\nOver all I never had\
  \ a real live public product running on parse to comment on the experience, but\
  \ for prototypes I'm perfectly happy with the service."
