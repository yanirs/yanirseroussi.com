body: 'Good article - I''ve always had a bit of problem with the term "Data Scientist"
  in that it infers that the person with such a title is somehow involved in research
  of data for scientific purposes or has a deep academic background neither of which
  are usually true.


  Now, what does everyone think about the term "Data Architect" - I could do a rant
  on that one.  Suffice it to say, you are a DATABASE Architect, not a DATA architect.  Data
  is data, it is just raw numbers. You don''t design data, you design a data model
  which eventually gets translated into a database.  Sorry, I guess that was a bit
  of a rant ...'
