body: 'I think exactly the same, but for the moment the title is somewhat needed.
  I''ll make my example: I''m a data scientist because my company wants to differentiate
  between regular data analysts (who can''t code but are learning with me helping
  them) and backend software engineers who can code better than me, but lack the business
  knowledge and have the tendency to trow fancy algorithms at numbers without thinking
  about method and usefulness for the business.


  Eventually we will have new job titles, but for now we are stuck with "data scientists".
  As soon as the hype will fade we''ll see people moving to new titles.'
