body: Great article! I also feel that anybody with an experience of 5 years and more
  in Data Science, can be considered for a Data Scientist role. Professionals with
  lesser experience can always have their roles as Data Analysts or Data Engineers.
  There are many certification programs that can provide you with relevant skill-sets,
  such as Hortonworks certification, Cloudera Certifications, Data Science Council
  of Ameria (DASCA) certifications etc.
