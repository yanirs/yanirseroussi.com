body: I find it interest that, as you said, data analysis is very useful if done by
  effective hires. It's important to understand the data that you are provided with
  and what context it fits in. Otherwise, you could come to conclusions that miss
  the mark. It is important to have those who are properly qualified analyze data
  accurately.
