  I have a question.


  When you say: "For example, minimising the mean absolute error (MAE) may require
  a different approach from minimising the mean square error (MSE)." can you explain
  what kind of approach (or methods, or rules of thumb) that your get to minimising
  MAE or MSE in machine learning?


  Thanks for your time in advance!


  Regards,


  Flavio'
