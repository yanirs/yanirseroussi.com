  The optimisation approach depends on the data and method you''re using.


  A basic example is when you don''t have any features, only a sample of target values.
  In that case, if you want to minimise the MAE you should choose the sample median,
  and if you want to minimise the MSE you should choose the sample mean. Here''s proof
  why: https://www.dropbox.com/s/b1195thcqebnxyn/mae-vs-rmse.pdf


  For more complex problems, if you''re using a machine learning package you can often
  specify the type of loss function to minimise (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_function#Selecting_a_loss_function).
  But even if your measure isn''t directly optimised (e.g., MAE is harder to minimise
  than MSE because it''s not differentiable at zero), you can always do cross-validation
  to find the parameters that optimise it.


  I hope this helps.'
