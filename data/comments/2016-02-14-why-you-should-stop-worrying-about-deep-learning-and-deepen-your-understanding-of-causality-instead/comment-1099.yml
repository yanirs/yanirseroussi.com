body: Interesting. I think that one of the dividing factors between traditional software
  engineering and data science is the attitude towards uncertainty. Whereas, as you
  say, coding is all about creating a controlled deterministic environment, data science
  and statistics thrive on uncertainty. It's similar with computer networks as well,
  where there is always a non-deterministic element (e.g., packets may be lost, arrive
  out-of-order, or come in bursts).
