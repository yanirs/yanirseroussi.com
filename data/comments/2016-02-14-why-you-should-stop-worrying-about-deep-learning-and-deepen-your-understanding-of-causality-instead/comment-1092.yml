body: 'There is a subtle difference between Woodward''s approach and that of Pearl
  and of Spirtes et al., which Glymour discusses in the following places:

  Basically, Woodward starts with the notion of an intervention on a variable and
  defines other concepts (e.g. direct cause) in terms of it, whereas Pearl and Spirtes
  et al. start with the notion of direct cause. One consequence of this difference
  is that properties like sex and race that cannot be intervened upon in a straightforward
  way cannot be causes for Woodward, strictly speaking, but can be for Pearl and Spirtes
  et al. This is a fine point, however, and it''s very nearly true that they simply
  provide alternative formulations of the same theory, with Woodward focusing on conceptual
  issues and the others focus on methodology.'
