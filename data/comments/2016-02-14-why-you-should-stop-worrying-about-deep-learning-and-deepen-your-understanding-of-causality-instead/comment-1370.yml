body: "\"According to Nicolas Malebranche and other seventeenth century Cartesian\
  \ occasionalists, what we actually call causes are really no more than \noccasions\
  \ on which, in accordance with his own laws, God acts to bring about the effect.\
  \ If one were to replace the notion of God in the occasionalism doctrine by the\
  \ notion of a mechanism, then a modern (ormechanical) occasionalist could assert\
  \ that what we actually call causes are no more than occasions on which a mechanism\
  \ acts to bring about the effect. \"\n\nMore info here:http://fqxi.org/community/forum/topic/846\
