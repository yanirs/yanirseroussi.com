body: I took a look at the Amazon sample for Causality, Probability and Time but I
  doubt if I'll buy it just yet. I've got Judea Pearl's Probabilistic Reasoning in
  Intelligent Systems already and think I want to work through that in a programming
  language (R is my first choice) before buying any more books. ;-)
