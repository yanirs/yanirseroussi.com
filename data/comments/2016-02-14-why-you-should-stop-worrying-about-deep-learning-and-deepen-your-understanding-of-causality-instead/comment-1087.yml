body: The problem with the search for causality (or, more generally, explainability)
  is that in many cases, it is "not interesting". If I click on Google search results,
  neither me nor Google algorithm developers are truly interested how the algorithm
  decided to rank Page A before Page B. It is OK for me, as an end user, not to care
  about those details, as much as I don't care hydraulics every  time I take a shower.
  Is it OK for me, as a data scientist, not to care about the reasons behind my models?
  Honestly, I don't yet know.
