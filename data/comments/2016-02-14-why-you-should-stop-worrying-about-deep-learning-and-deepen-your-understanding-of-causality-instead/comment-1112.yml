  I have been afraid of being lost in Big data ie swarmed by such a vast amount of
  correlations.

  So understanding causality is important to make better better decision.

  Not being a data scientist but a startuper, my approach is to trying to understand
  how many signals I perceive and what storytelling I do with them; then what vision
  of reality I get...D Kahneman it''s great help as we should always be aware that
  our story is made up of only a small proportion of all signals and the causilty
  we build into a story it''s only one among many.

  So, how we improve the process??

  Still searching;)
