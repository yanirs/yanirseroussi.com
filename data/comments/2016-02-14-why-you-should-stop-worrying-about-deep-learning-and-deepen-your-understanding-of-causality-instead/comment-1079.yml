body: I appreciate this post. I teach General Psychology, and this is a central issue
  that I present to my students. In the meantime, I regularly come across articles,
  in peer-reviewed as wells as mainstream publications, which discuss correlational
  data as if it were supporting a causal relationship. As I tell my students, one
  of the difficulties is the use of the word "factor" in both types of discussions.
  In correlation, factors are pieces of information which give you a more likely guess
  about an unknown piece of information.  In causation, factors are things that contribute
  to something else existing. Both concepts feed the mind's desire to find patterns
  in the relevant world which inform our decisions/behaviors so that we can continue
  living, hopefully in a pleasant state.  We are often tricked by these patterns (illusions,
  etc.), but most of the time they pan out in a beneficial way.  Making the leap from
  "this is how things tend to work in my immediate experience" to "this is how things
  work everywhere for everyone" is where theories are born, where science lives, and
  where we often make mistakes along the way. Proceed with caution from observation
  to theory, but by all means, proceed!
