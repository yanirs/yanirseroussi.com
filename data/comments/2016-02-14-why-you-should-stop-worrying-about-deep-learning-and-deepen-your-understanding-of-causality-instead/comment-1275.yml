body: My understanding is that causality is always the central focus of science.  Machine
  learning/data mining is a relatively more recent thing, and its greatest benefit
  lies in solving complex prediction problems.  But I think causality study and data
  mining can help each other.  For the purpose of understanding causality, data mining
  can be used in an exploratory way that helps scientists to generate theories (I
  think it is possible to study the features (i.e., hidden units) extracted by deep
  learning networks), then experiments, longitudinal studies and traditional stats
  can be used to test the theories.    For the purpose of solving practical prediction
  problems, theories developed from causality studies can help identify useful features
  as input to the machine learning algorithms.  In fact, this was done all the times
  especially before deep learning became popular.  I agree that scientists should
  improve their understanding of causality, but picking up new technologies that take
  advantage of modern computers and large data won't really hurt.
