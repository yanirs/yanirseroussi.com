body: "Great writeup! \nI think causality will become something that data scientists\
  \ will need to acknowledge and think about more explicitly.\n\nComing from machine\
  \ learning, it took me a while to wrap my head around the subtle but important differences\
  \ in the way similar ideas are used in prediction vs. causal inference.\n\nRecently\
  \ I gave an ICML tutorial about causality, together with David Sontag. This might\
  \ be of interest to your readers as a starting point, particulalry for people who\
  \ are well-versed in ML. It's here:\nwww.cs.nyu.edu/~shalit/tutorial.html"
