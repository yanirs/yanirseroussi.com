body: 'I agree that in many cases the reasoning behind models isn''t interesting,
  as long as the models produce satisfactory results. Web search is actually a good
  example. Yes, many end users don''t really care how Google ranks pages, but SEO
  practitioners go to great lengths to understand search algorithms and get pages
  to rank well (see https://moz.com/search-ranking-factors for example).


  As data scientists, it''s important to consider model stability in production. Sculley
  et al. said it well in their paper on machine learning technical debt (http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/43146.pdf):
  "Machine learning systems often have a difficult time distinguishing the impact
  of correlated features. This may not seem like a major problem: if two features
  are always correlated, but only one is truly causal, it may still seem okay to ascribe
  credit to both and rely on their observed co-occurrence. However, if the world suddenly
  stops making these features co-occur, prediction behavior may change significantly."


  Finally, in many cases what we really care about is interventionality. I don''t
  think it''s a real word, but what it means is that you don''t really care whether
  A causes B, you want to know whether intervening to change A would change B. These
  inferences are critical in fields like medicine and marketing, but we can look at
  an example from the world of blogging, which is probably more relevant to you. Many
  bloggers would like to attract more readers. A possible costly intervention would
  be to switch platforms from WordPress to Medium. Cheaper interventions may be changing
  the site''s layout, writing titles that get people interested, and posting links
  to your content on relevant channels. Another intervention would be trying to post
  at different times (as implied by WordPress insights and discussed in http://yanirseroussi.com/2015/12/08/this-holiday-season-give-me-real-insights/).
  Obviously, one would like to apply the interventions with the highest return on
  investment first, and data that helps with ranking the interventions is very interesting.'
