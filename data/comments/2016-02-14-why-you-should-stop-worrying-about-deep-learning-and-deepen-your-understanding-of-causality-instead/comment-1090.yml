body: I've been thinking about this lately quite a bit. The fact that I can type this
  comment and send it across the internet rests on the ability to create a completely
  controlled causal environment. Inside the computer, all noise and randomness is
  kept below the threshold of the data, and every process is completely causal. Meanwhile,
  outside the computer, most measurements are mostly noise, and extracting any sort
  of causal relation is very difficult and often impossible. My mind seems to have
  some sort of idea of cause as something like the interaction of balls on a pool
  table. The que ball strikes the eight ball and knocks it into the corner pocket,
  etc. But when one tries to measure things, mostly one finds nothing like this. Instead,
  one finds that some measurements tend to be found with other measurements most of
  the time, but not all of the time. Cause thus seems a statistical thing, and in
  no way absolute. I have difficulty reconciling the two views. One thing that occured
  to me to investigate, was the manner in which several huge internet outages developed
  involving the BGP protocol. It seemed to me that every individual packet must experience
  a completely causal path, but the aggregate turns into the statistical causal form
  we most usually deal with. I haven't followed up with this idea so far, however
