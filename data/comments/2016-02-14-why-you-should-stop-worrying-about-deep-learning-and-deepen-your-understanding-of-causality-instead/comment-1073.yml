body: "It seems to me that causality is another of our thought conveniences, just\
  \ one more attempt at linearising our frustratingly non-linear existence, akin to\
  \ teaching with Newtonian physics, segue to Einstein\u2019s relativistic mechanics\
  \ when the kids are ready (if ever). Cyclic systems can self-perpetuate in non-repeating\
  \ cycles (chaos theory) but also respond with or resist change arising from external\
  \ inputs. I believe when people speak of causality, what they are really thinking\
  \ about (and desiring) is a conversation around stability versus volatility."
