body: Thanks Ralph! I meant the last sentence in the sense of "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/And_yet_it_moves"
  target="_blank" rel="nofollow">and yet it moves</a>". People's actions and choices
  are definitely affected by demagoguery and misinformation, but the spread of misinformation
  doesn't change reality by itself. For example, Trump et al.'s climate science denialism
  isn't going to alter the reality of anthropogenic climate change, though their actions
  are probably going to accelerate it.
