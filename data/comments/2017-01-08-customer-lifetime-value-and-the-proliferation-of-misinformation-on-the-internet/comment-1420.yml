body: 'When I started doing data science in a business setting (after years of doing
  quantitative genetics in academic settings), I was puzzled by the talk of "customer
  lifetime value", partly due to the issues you''ve mentioned. Even with appropriate
  clarifications - it''s over, say, five years, not forever, etc. - it''s a peculiar
  quantity, in that as typically calculated, at least by the business-y people in
  my vicinity, it isn''t an average over a single population of customers. Instead,
  it''s average, say, first-month net present value over customers who''ve been around
  for at least one month (or maybe over all such customers who''ve also been around
  for at most one year, to reduce the influence of customer behavior farther in the
  past, when the product catalog, marketing strategies, etc. were different), plus
  average second-month net present value over customers who''ve been around for at
  least two months, etc., that is, it''s a sum of averages over a sequence of populations
  of customers (which may not even be nested). And there can be further subtleties.
  For example, in the context of a "freemium" service such as the one that is my primary
  client at present, sometimes people want to measure time from when a customer signs
  up for an account, whereas other times people want to measure time from when a customer
  first buys something, which may be much later. Altogether, I''ve found that "customer
  lifetime value" generally requires a good deal of explanation.


  "no amount of cheap demagoguery and misinformation can alter the objective reality
  of our world.": Alas, that isn''t quite true. Next week, the objective reality of
  how the USA is governed will be altered substantially, partly due to blatant demagoguery
  and misinformation.'
