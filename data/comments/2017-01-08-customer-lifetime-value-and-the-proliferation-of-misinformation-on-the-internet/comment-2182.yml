body: Thanks Eleni! I think that in the case of subscription-based products, you're
  better off using different models, as churn is observed and can be predicted (e.g.,
  using a package like <a href="https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/lifelines" rel="nofollow">lifelines</a>).
  Once you have an estimate of when a customer is going to churn, it's easy to estimate
  their LTV (assuming constant recurring revenue). In any case, the general principle
  of not using closed formulas without testing their accuracy on your data still applies
  here.
