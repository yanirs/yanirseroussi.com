body: Thanks for the article, Yanir! I am a huge proponent of only using formulas for CLV as a starting point, used only when historical similar models aren't available, When a good historical financial model is available, it becomes much more useful than the generic formula. I was just speaking with service vendor who was trying to convince to allow his company to perform exhaustive FMEA's on all of our equipment when we had years of failure data to approach a maintenance strategy. Only rely on theoretical when empirical isn't an option.
