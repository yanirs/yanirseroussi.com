Are you...
* ...a startup leader considering your first AI/ML project?
* ...a data professional thinking of joining a startup?
* ...an investor assessing the viability of a startup's AI/ML plans?
* ...a consultant helping startups ship data-intensive solutions?

If the answer is yes to any of the above, download my free _Data-to-AI Health Check for Startups_ PDF to help guide your next steps.

In the guide, you'll find a set of questions to help you assess a startup's data/AI/ML health, as well as the business context in which data/AI/ML projects get shipped. 

The questions and scoring guidance cover [eight areas](https://yanirseroussi.com/2024/04/22/assessing-a-startups-data-to-ai-health/), resulting in the scorecard shown below.
