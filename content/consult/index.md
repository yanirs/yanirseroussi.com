This is a high-level overview of my approach to consulting and the sort of problems I can help with. Feel free to [contact me](/about/#contact-me) for more details.

## Principles

When approaching consulting engagements, I aim to follow these key principles:

- Getting to the root of business problems.
- Iteratively implementing pragmatic solutions.
- Saying what I'll do, doing what I said, and communicating if anything changes.

## Offerings

With [my broad experience in data science, software engineering, and artificial intelligence](/about/), I can help in a variety of situations. My key offerings are:

- Short one-off advisory sessions to address specific challenges and questions ([book paid call](https://talkw.me/@yanir)).
- Longer engagements to tackle data & AI problems, which start with problem discovery and lead to hands-on implementation work ([contact me to discuss](/about/#contact-me)).
- Mid-to-long term engagements as a Fractional Chief Data & AI Officer for startups and scaleups (see [slide deck](/fractional-chief-data-officer/#/) for details).

## Examples

Examples of the above offerings:

- A short call to discuss an ongoing computer vision project, where the client was unsure the consultant they've retained was on the right path. I provided advice on where they should focus, based on my experience with best practices in such projects.
- An [internal consulting project with Automattic](https://data.blog/2019/01/15/how-to-increase-retention-and-revenue-in-1000-nontrivial-steps/), where the aim was to increase WordPress.com customer retention rates. Artefacts from this project are still in use by the company five years later. 
- I served in data & AI leadership roles with multiple startups. While those weren't fractional, a clear theme is that it's hard for non-data people to make the first data hires and give them the right tasks. These are the sort of items I can help with fractionally.

## Ideal clients and areas

My main interest these days is to apply my skills within the climate tech and nature-positive sector. However, I'm happy to discuss any project that is likely to have a positive impact on humanity and our shared environment.

I have worked with large companies (Intel, Qualcomm, Google, and Commonwealth Bank), medium-size businesses (Automattic &ndash; WordPress.com), several startups (like Orkestra &ndash; renewable energy space and Car Next Door &ndash; now Uber Carshare), and nonprofits (Reef Life Survey, GetUp!, and Work on Climate). As an independent consultant, I prefer working with stakeholders who have skin in the game, which typically means working with small-to-medium organisations in settings where it's possible to quickly ship iterative solutions.
