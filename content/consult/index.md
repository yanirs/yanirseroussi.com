This is a high-level overview of my approach to consulting and the sort of problems I can help with. Feel free to [contact me](/contact/) for more details.

## Offerings

With [my broad experience in data science, software engineering, and artificial intelligence](/about/), I can help in a variety of situations. My key offerings are:

- Short one-off advisory sessions to address specific challenges and questions ([book Data-to-AI Strategy Consultation call](https://calendly.com/yanir-seroussi/data-to-ai-strategy-consultation)).
- Longer engagements to tackle data & AI problems ([contact me to discuss](/contact/)). These have two components:
  1. Problem definition and strategic planning; and
  2. Help with implementation (if I don't have the capacity to do it, I'll connect you with the right people).
- Mid-to-long term engagements as a [Fractional Chief Data & AI Officer for startups and scaleups](/fractional-chief-data-officer/#/).

## Principles

When approaching consulting engagements, I aim to follow these key principles:

- Getting to know you and the root of your business problems.
- Iteratively implementing pragmatic solutions.
- Saying what I'll do, doing what I said, and communicating if anything changes.

## Examples

Examples of the above offerings:

- A short call to discuss an ongoing computer vision project, where the client was unsure the consultant they've retained was on the right path. I provided advice on where they should focus, based on my experience with best practices in such projects.
- An [internal consulting project with Automattic](https://data.blog/2019/01/15/how-to-increase-retention-and-revenue-in-1000-nontrivial-steps/), where the aim was to increase WordPress.com customer retention rates. Artefacts from this project are still in use by the company five years later. 
- I served in data & AI leadership roles with multiple startups. While those weren't fractional, a clear theme is that it's hard for non-data people to make [the first data hires](https://yanirseroussi.com/2024/02/05/substance-over-titles-your-first-data-hire-may-be-a-data-scientist/) and give them the right tasks. These are the sort of items I can help with fractionally.

## Ideal clients and areas

My main interest these days is helping startups and scaleups within the climate tech and nature-positive sector. However, I'm happy to discuss any project that is likely to have a positive impact on humanity and our shared environment.

I have worked with large companies (Intel, Qualcomm, Google, and Commonwealth Bank), a unicorn scaleup (Automattic &ndash; WordPress.com), several startups (like Orkestra &ndash; renewable energy space, and Car Next Door &ndash; now Uber Carshare), and nonprofits (Reef Life Survey, GetUp!, and Work on Climate). As an independent consultant, I prefer working with stakeholders who have skin in the game, which typically means working with small-to-medium organisations in settings where it's possible to quickly ship iterative solutions.
