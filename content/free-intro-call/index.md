Hello! üê≥

So... you've been poking around my website and [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yanirseroussi/), and you think we'd benefit from a quick intro call.

Well, you've come to the right place!

But first, note that there are [other ways to contact me](/contact/) that may be more effective.

Second, I also offer [longer one-hour advisory calls](https://calendly.com/yanir-seroussi/data-to-ai-strategy-consultation). You get to set the agenda for such calls, but the focus there is typically on your Data-to-AI Strategy.

Third, nothing is truly free. Filling the form below will subscribe you to my weekly mailing list. If you made it here, you probably want that anyway (you can always unsubscribe).

Once you submit the form, you'll receive a confirmation email with the booking link for the call.

{{<subscribe_form
    email_label="Register for a free fifteen-minute call"
    form_id=6599419
    show_rss=false
    submit_label="Register"
    success_message="Success! Now check your email for booking details."
    tag_id=5031249
