I did some AI consulting for computer vision. A lot of times, the value that I brought to the company was telling them not to use AI. I was the AI expert, and they described the problem, and I said, "Don't use AI." This is my value add.

Last year, I went through some exercises to clarify what I do for clients. I ended up with descriptions of various lengths, but still felt like I needed something shorter and more generic. Then it hit me – I'm an **AI/ML Success Architect!**

To my surprise, a Google search for the exact term yielded zero results, so I quickly changed my website title to claim it. Now, it's time to define the title in more detail.

There are three parts:

1. **AI/ML**: Artificial intelligence and machine learning. Technically, ML is a part of AI, but given the GenAI explosion of the past few years, explicitly including ML is meant to differentiate from those who only work on integrations of pre-trained GenAI models.
2. **Architect**: [My technical background spans software engineering and data science](https://yanirseroussi.com/about/), but I'm too old, opinionated, and expensive to be implementing tasks without having a say in higher-level planning. I still enjoy doing some implementation work, but the word _Architect_ matches the level where I should be operating – not just engineering but also strategy and design.
3. **Success**: This is the key difference from existing titles. Searches for _"AI/ML Architect"_ yield many results, but the title implies there's an AI/ML system that needs architecting. However, the best way to succeed with AI/ML is often to avoid, defer, or reframe the project. This is demonstrated by the quote from Karpathy above and by [Google's first rule of ML](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides/rules-of-ml): _"Don't be afraid to launch a product without machine learning"_. No amount of hype or tech advancement is going to change the principle of using the simplest and most cost-effective solution to a given problem. Sometimes it's AI and sometimes it isn't. I'm committed to the success of my clients, which means avoiding hype-driven development and AI for the sake of AI.

My commitment to AI/ML success and to serving people and causes I care about is a large part of why I work independently rather than as an employee. It makes it easier to say no to unnecessary projects, and avoid going down the path of [reluctant data engineering](https://yanirseroussi.com/2023/10/25/lessons-from-reluctant-data-engineering/).

My current LinkedIn tagline is _"helping climate tech founders ship AI/ML solutions that support multi-million dollar growth goals"_. This means my typical leads have a low chance of success, as more than [90% of startups](https://www.failory.com/blog/startup-failure-rate) and [80% of AI/ML projects](https://www.qut.edu.au/insights/business/understanding-the-looming-ai-crisis-why-do-so-many-data-science-projects-fail) fail. By working with founders who are a good fit – and by helping them avoid overinvestment in AI/ML – my aim is to help them beat the odds and successfully ascend the AI/ML maturity curve.
