About a year ago, I was experimenting with frequent posting on LinkedIn.
One post didn't get much attention, but led to a catch-up call with a friend and former colleague.
That colleague told me about [Tribe AI](https://www.tribe.ai/) – a talent network and community for AI professionals.

I applied to join Tribe AI, made it through the selection process, and then... mostly forgot about it.

That changed a few months ago.
As I was travelling in North America, I happened to be awake for a Tribe webinar on one of my favourite topics: GenAI Evals.
That webinar led to a collaboration with Tribe on a project to add guardrails to their platform.

Implementing guardrails turned out to be much more involved than expected.
For the full technical breakdown, head to [my article on the Tribe website](https://www.tribe.ai/applied-ai/what-no-one-tells-you-about-guardrails).
Here, I just wanted to reflect on how posting into the void can lead to unexpected outcomes.
