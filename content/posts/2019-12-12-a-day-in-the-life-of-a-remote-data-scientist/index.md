Earlier this year, I gave a talk titled _A Day in the Life of a Remote Data Scientist_ at [the Data Science Sydney meetup][1]. The talk covered similar ground to [a post I published on remote data science work][2], with additional details on my daily schedule and projects, some gifs and Sydney jokes, heckling by the audience, and a Q&A session. I managed to watch it a few months ago without cringing too much, so it's about time to post it here. [The slides are on my GitHub][3], as is [my list of established remote companies][4], which you may find useful if you want to join the remote work fun.
