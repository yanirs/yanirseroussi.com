In previous posts about getting traction for my <a href="http://www.bcrecommender.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bandcamp recommendations project (BCRecommender)</a>, I mentioned search engine optimisation (SEO) as one of the promising traction channels. Unfortunately, early efforts yielded negligible traffic â€“ [most new visitors came from referrals from blogs and Twitter][1]. It turns out that the problem was **not showing up for the SEO game**: most of BCRecommender's pages were blocked for crawling via robots.txt because I was worried that search engines (=Google) would penalise the website for <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/2604719?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thin/duplicate content</a>.

Recently, I beefed up most of the pages, created a sitemap, and removed most pages from robots.txt. This resulted in a significant increase in traffic, as illustrated by the above graph. The number of organic impressions went up from less than ten per day to over a thousand. This is expected to go up even further, as only about 10% of pages are indexed. In addition, some traffic went to my staging site because it wasn't blocked from crawling (I had to set up a new staging site that is password-protected and add a redirect from the old site to the production site &ndash; a bit annoying but I couldn't find a better solution).

I hope Google won't suddenly decide that BCRecommender content is not valuable or too thin. The content is automatically generated, which is <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/2721306" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"bad"</a>, but it doesn't "consist of paragraphs of random text that make no sense to the reader but which may contain search keywords". As a (completely unbiased) user, I think it is valuable to find similar albums when searching for an album you like &ndash; an example that represents the majority of people that click through to BCRecommender. Judging from the main engagement measure I'm using (time spent on site), a good number of these people are happy with what they find.

More updates to come in the future. For now, my conclusion is: thin content is better than no content, as long as it's relevant to what people are searching for and provides real value.
