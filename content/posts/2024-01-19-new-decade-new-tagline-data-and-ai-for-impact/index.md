Exactly a decade ago, on 19th January 2014, I published my first post on this website ([Kaggle beginner tips](https://yanirseroussi.com/2014/01/19/kaggle-beginner-tips/)). In most of the following years, my tagline was _Data Science and Beyond_. While the _beyond_ bit gave me an excuse to write about various topics, [most posts were indeed around data science](https://yanirseroussi.com/tags/data-science/) &ndash; an area that [also became broader](https://yanirseroussi.com/2018/07/22/defining-data-science-in-2018/) (arguably to [the point of uselessness](https://yanirseroussi.com/2016/08/04/is-data-scientist-a-useless-job-title/)).

While I've never abandoned my software engineering roots, the broadening of data science means that [many data scientists can no longer be assumed to possess solid engineering skills](https://yanirseroussi.com/2023/06/30/was-data-science-a-failure-mode-of-software-engineering/). Therefore, I changed the tagline last year to _Engineering Data Science & More_. However, this didn't feel quite right &ndash; some people now have an adverse reaction to any mention of data science, after negative experiences of failed projects.

Recently, I switched the tagline to be both broader and narrower: _Data & AI for Nature_. However, upon reflection and given some feedback, I realised that the _Nature_ bit may be off-putting to some people who do impactful work in the space but have different motivations. Therefore, I decided to go with _Data & AI for Impact_ (for now...).

**More importantly, I'm planning to revitalise my approach to publishing and audience engagement:**
* Post more frequently &ndash; aiming for weekly from February onwards.
* Use the mailing list to email full posts, and as a two-way avenue for comments and conversations (as opposed to public comments, which are now closed).
* Still publish both technical and high-level posts on Data & AI.
* Produce content that's specifically useful for startups and scaleups that are early on their Data & AI journey.
* Showcase positive-impact applications of Data & AI tech &ndash; especially by startups in the climate and nature-positive space.

With more frequent posts, what I publish should be quicker to produce and consume. This means I may lean more heavily on showcasing other people's work &ndash; possibly through interviews. Other than that, here are some rough post ideas for the immediate future:
* Series on a minimum viable data stack
* Best practices and opinions on a startup's first data hire
* Answering questions people ask on the future of data science
* My experience as a Data Tech Lead with Work on Climate
* Use cases for ChatGPT and other LLMs
* Catching up on different aspects of LLMs / AI tech
* Opportunities for Data & AI professionals in the energy transition
 
Historically, for each post I've published, about 5-10 ideas went unpublished. I hope that by aiming for shorter and lower-friction publishing, more posts will see the light of day.

My long-term aims are to learn by publishing, apply my Data & AI skills towards more positive impact, and help others in the space. Rather than sinking into doom and gloom, I'd like to focus on positive applications of Data & AI tech that make our world better (in the spirit of publications like [Volts](https://www.volts.wtf/)).

**Call to action:**
* If this all sounds uninteresting to you, you're welcome to unsubscribe &ndash; no hard feelings.
* If you know people I should talk to and feature in future posts, I'd appreciate an intro.
* If you have any suggestions, please send them by replying to any of my emails, or [contact me through other means](https://yanirseroussi.com/contact/) &ndash; I'd love to hear from you.
