Hi!

My name is Yanir Seroussi. This website/blog is mostly meant to group together stuff I write in various places. It's mainly focused on data science.

I'm an experienced data scientist and software engineer with a strong background in computer science, programming, machine learning, and statistics. My work spans the full spectrum from solving isolated data problems to building production systems that serve millions of users. I've produced top results in various areas such as recommender systems, text mining, price forecasting, and personalisation. Examples include: ranking highly as a [Kaggle Master][1], producing [award-winning PhD work][2], and [implementing live systems][3] that substantially increase revenue through smart use of data. With a proven capability to work independently and in teams, lead and mentor co-workers, and communicate with both technical and non-technical stakeholders, I consistently deliver value to a variety of clients and projects. See my [LinkedIn profile][3] for more details.

I'm always happy to chat about data science and related topics. If you'd like to contact me, please [use my contact form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeibojYvmFUDC284wTybWAuWJ4rHi6j6SnF8ZiZt8zBIyi8vw/viewform), [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/yanirs/yanirseroussi.com/issues), [drop me a line on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yanirseroussi), or email `contact` at this domain.
