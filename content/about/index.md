## Data & AI Expert?

As noted on [the homepage](https://yanirseroussi.com/), you should beware of self-proclaimed experts on the internet and do your own due diligence. I cringe putting the word _expert_ next to my name, as there's so much to know and learn, especially in a broad area like Data & AI. Still, underselling myself would also be silly. I'll let you be the judge.

**âš¡ New!** These days, I provide independent consulting services around Data & AI, focusing on small-to-medium organisations in the climate tech and nature-positive sector. See [my consulting page](/consult/) for details, or [scroll down to contact me](#contact-me).

## Obligatory self-promotional blurb

I'm an experienced data scientist and software engineer with a deep background in computer science, programming, machine learning, and statistics. My work spans the full spectrum from solving isolated data problems to building production systems that serve millions of users. With a proven capability to work independently and in teams, lead and mentor co-workers, and communicate with both technical and non-technical stakeholders, I consistently deliver value to a variety of clients and projects.

## Proof points

Words are cheap. Any chatbot could generate a blurb like the above. Let's go deeper with a few highlights from my work:

* **Building production systems that serve millions of users.** In [my work with Automattic](https://yanirseroussi.com/2021/10/07/my-work-with-automattic/), I re-architected and led the implementation of the company's unified online experimentation platform, and co-led the implementation of machine learning pipelines that had a significant impact on revenue from marketing campaigns.
* **Solving isolated data & machine learning problems.** I'm [a retired Kaggle competition master](https://www.kaggle.com/yanirseroussi), having [ranked in the top ten of the five competitions I participated in](https://yanirseroussi.com/kaggle/). I've also worked on various other problems throughout my career, but many of them haven't resulted in public artefacts &ndash; such is the nature of commercial data.
* **Software engineering and programming expertise.** My undergraduate degree was in computer science, with a focus on software engineering. I graduated first in class from [the Technion &ndash; a top Israeli university](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technion_%E2%80%93_Israel_Institute_of_Technology). My early career included software engineering work with big tech companies (Intel, Qualcomm, and Google). I chose to work with startups after my PhD, before going back to a medium tech company (Automattic), and then [returning to the startup and freelancing worlds](https://yanirseroussi.com/2022/06/06/the-mission-matters-moving-to-climate-tech-as-a-data-scientist/). All my roles included a substantial hands-on coding component. I take software engineering seriously and strive to keep on top of and apply best practices, as [solid software is the foundation of all data work](https://yanirseroussi.com/2014/08/17/datas-hierarchy-of-needs/).
* **Artificial intelligence and data science expertise.** In my PhD I formally specialised in artificial intelligence. As the term _artificial intelligence_ was falling out of favour when I submitted my thesis in 2012, I also say that my PhD is in _data science_ (which may be decreasing in popularity in 2023). Either way, it resulted in [some publications in top venues](https://yanirseroussi.com/phd-work/) and [won an award for the best thesis in my faculty](https://www.monash.edu/news/articles/top-of-the-class) at [Monash &ndash; a leading Australian university](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monash_University). Personally, I don't think it's a big deal, but people seem to love PhDs and other credentials! Since my PhD, I've continued learning and honing my skills, as reflected by [posts on this site](https://yanirseroussi.com/) and [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yanirseroussi/).

## Outcomes beat job titles

One of the downsides of working in an ever-changing field and accumulating a broad range of experiences is that it's hard to summarise with a concise title. For example, being a data scientist [used to imply having strong software engineering skills](https://yanirseroussi.com/2014/10/23/what-is-data-science/), but [this has changed over time](https://yanirseroussi.com/2023/06/30/was-data-science-a-failure-mode-of-software-engineering/). It's a similar story with the decline and rise of artificial intelligence. In an ideal world, I'd be able to let my work speak for itself, but we don't live in such a world (in fact, [human work is obsolete in my ideal world](https://yanirseroussi.com/2023/04/21/remaining-relevant-as-a-small-language-model/)). In our world, people search for keywords and have different understandings of concepts, e.g., they may want "an AI solution" to a problem that can be solved with deterministic software engineering. Or they may believe they need an AI Engineer rather than a Data Scientist, when a few years ago it'd have been the opposite (as I'm writing this in 2023, you could replace the words _data science_ with _artificial intelligence_ across my historical posts and much of what I wrote would still hold).

Anyway, whether you're trying to navigate Data & AI terminology or solve specific problems, I can probably help. As noted in [my consulting page](/consult/), my aim is to get to the root of business problems and iteratively implement pragmatic solutions. The taxonomy of Data & AI professionals is only relevant if I'm helping you hire a team.
