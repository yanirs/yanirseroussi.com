summary: While I found the story of Gumroad interesting, The Minimalist Entrepreneur seems to over-generalise from the founder's experience.

I picked up [_The Minimalist Entrepreneur_](https://askmybook.com/) by Sahil Lavingia from the local library after coming across [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/) a few times and getting intrigued by [its creation story](https://sahillavingia.com/reflecting). I was hoping for general but useful advice on starting a bootstrapped business, but was disappointed by the overly prescriptive nature of the book. It feels like the author over-generalised from his own experience, e.g., in emphasising organic community-based growth over other marketing channels, and in insisting that one must share the story of building the business on social media. Example quote: _"people don't care about your business and its success, they care about you and your struggles"_ &ndash; I'd say that most people don't care about either you or your business, but I can see how Sahil's story is interesting to Gumroad's users (who are also small business owners / creators). There are countless examples of products I use where I know nothing about the people who make them. I use those products because they address a need or a want.

The book was off to a good start with Sahil's story and advice that is in line with advice from _Start Small, Stay Small_, which I [revisited recently](https://yanirseroussi.com/til/2023/08/16/revisiting-start-small-stay-small-in-2023-chapter-1/). However, beyond around the midpoint of the book, I started losing patience with its prescriptiveness and began speed-reading and skipping irrelevant stories. As [one Goodreads reviewer said](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5204025999), the book felt like _"three blog posts in a trench coat"_, which I suppose is unsurprising as it was born out of a blog post.

Given that it was a quick weekend read, the book wasn't a complete waste of time. It probably would have been better if it remained focused on Sahil's own story, which I found the most engaging. The best advice is perhaps in the intro: _"You definitely do not need to finish this book to start. [...] You start, then learn"_.
