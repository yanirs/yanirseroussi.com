Since realising that [the lines between solo consulting and product building are blurry](https://yanirseroussi.com/til/2023/09/25/the-lines-between-solo-consulting-and-product-building-are-blurry/), I've been consuming a lot of [Jonathan Stark's](https://jonathanstark.com/) materials on positioning, value pricing, and related topics. I mostly read and listen to his content, but this short video hits the nail on the head:

The quick summary is that you should have the following before you quit your job to become a solo consultant:
1. **Confidence** that you can deliver immediate value to your clients.
2. **Cash** to get you through the tough times.
3. **Connections** to ideal buyers in your target market.

When I quit my last job, my plan was to take some time off, and then look at building a solo product business. It took me a while to consider consulting as a serious pursuit &ndash; I was definitely not thinking of things like _ideal buyers in my target market_, let alone how to connect to them and maintain relationships over time. I do have the confidence, and I'm not strapped for cash, but getting the positioning right and building connections is a long-term play. Anyone who's quitting with the intention of consulting a soloist should definitely keep the three Cs in mind!
