I recently picked up the Audible version of [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits), mostly because I kept seeing it everywhere. I wasn't disappointed. It immediately gave me ideas for improving my routines based on a cursory listen. I will definitely revisit it and refer to resources like [the habit cheat sheet](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jamesclear/Atomic+Habits/Habits+Cheat+Sheet.pdf) in the future.

As a test, I used several tips to form better habits around sending messages (which is often a cause for procrastination):
- Habit stacking: Send one message after my morning workout (chained to an existing positive habit).
- Temptation bundling and reinforcement: After the message is out, have a snack.
- Tracking: Tick a box once the message is sent, which adds up to a lovely streak.

...and it worked! It feels a bit odd consciously training myself like this, but it's better than the alternative of sticking to bad habits and procrastination.
