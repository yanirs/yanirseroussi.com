Unfortunately, early efforts yielded negligible traffic – most new visitors came from referrals from blogs and Twitter. It turns out that the problem was not showing up for the SEO game: most of BCRecommender&amp;rsquo;s pages were blocked for crawling via robots.txt because I was worried that search engines (=Google) would penalise the website for thin/duplicate content.</description></item><item><title>BCRecommender Traction Update</title><link>https://yanirs.github.io/yanirseroussi.com/2014/11/05/bcrecommender-traction-update/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2014 02:29:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yanirs.github.io/yanirseroussi.com/2014/11/05/bcrecommender-traction-update/</guid><description>This is the fifth part of a series of posts on my Bandcamp recommendations (BCRecommender) project. Check out previous posts on the general motivation behind this project, the system’s architecture, the recommendation algorithms, and initial traction planning. In a previous post, I discussed my plans to apply the Bullseye framework from the Traction Book to BCRecommender, my Bandcamp recommendations project.

It could probably be extended to attract a wider audience of music lovers, but for now, just getting feedback from Bandcamp fans would be enough.</description></item></channel></rss>
