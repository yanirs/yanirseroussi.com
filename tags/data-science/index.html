Recently, I spent a month sailing down the northern Great Barrier Reef, collecting data for the Reef Life Survey project. In addition to being a great diving experience, the trip helped me obtain general insights on data collection and machine learning, which are shared in this article.
The Reef Life Survey project Reef Life Survey (RLS) is a citizen scientist project, led by a team from the University of Tasmania....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2016-01-24 00:32:25 +0000 UTC'>January 24, 2016</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;Yanir Seroussi</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to The joys of offline data collection" href=https://yanirseroussi.com/2016/01/24/the-joys-of-offline-data-collection/></a></article><article class="post-entry tag-entry"><header class=entry-header><h2>This holiday season, give me real insights</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>Merriam-Webster defines an insight as an understanding of the true nature of something.
