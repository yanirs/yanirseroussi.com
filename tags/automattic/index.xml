The talk covered similar ground to a post I published on remote data science work, with additional details on my daily schedule and projects, some gifs and Sydney jokes, heckling by the audience, and a Q&amp;amp;A session. I managed to watch it a few months ago without cringing too much, so it&amp;rsquo;s about time to post it here.</description></item><item><title>Reflections on remote data science work</title><link>https://yanirseroussi.com/2018/11/03/reflections-on-remote-data-science-work/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Nov 2018 06:33:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yanirseroussi.com/2018/11/03/reflections-on-remote-data-science-work/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s been about a year and a half since I joined Automattic as a remote data scientist. This is the longest I&amp;rsquo;ve been in one position since finishing my PhD in 2012. This is also the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve worked full-time with a fully-distributed team. In this post, I briefly discuss some of the top pluses and minuses of remote work, based on my experience so far.

Automattic is a fully-distributed company, which means that all of its employees work remotely (hence pants are optional). While the book discusses some of the challenges of working remotely, the author&amp;rsquo;s general experience was very positive. A few months after reading the book, I decided to look for a full-time position after a period of independent work.</description></item></channel></rss>
