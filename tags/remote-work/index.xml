In general, my guiding principle for posting is to only add stuff I&amp;rsquo;d want to read or cite, e.g., because I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen it discussed elsewhere. Well, no one has compiled a meta-post of my public work from 2020 (that I know of), so it&amp;rsquo;s finally time to publish it myself.</description></item><item><title>A day in the life of a remote data scientist</title><link>https://yanirseroussi.com/2019/12/12/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-remote-data-scientist/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Dec 2019 22:06:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yanirseroussi.com/2019/12/12/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-remote-data-scientist/</guid><description>Earlier this year, I gave a talk titled A Day in the Life of a Remote Data Scientist at the Data Science Sydney meetup. The talk covered similar ground to a post I published on remote data science work, with additional details on my daily schedule and projects, some gifs and Sydney jokes, heckling by the audience, and a Q&amp;amp;A session. I managed to watch it a few months ago without cringing too much, so it&amp;rsquo;s about time to post it here.</description></item><item><title>Reflections on remote data science work</title><link>https://yanirseroussi.com/2018/11/03/reflections-on-remote-data-science-work/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Nov 2018 06:33:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yanirseroussi.com/2018/11/03/reflections-on-remote-data-science-work/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s been about a year and a half since I joined Automattic as a remote data scientist. This is the longest I&amp;rsquo;ve been in one position since finishing my PhD in 2012. This is also the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve worked full-time with a fully-distributed team. In this post, I briefly discuss some of the top pluses and minuses of remote work, based on my experience so far.
