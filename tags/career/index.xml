This is the longest I&amp;rsquo;ve been in one position since finishing my PhD in 2012. This is also the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve worked full-time with a fully-distributed team. In this post, I briefly discuss some of the top pluses and minuses of remote work, based on my experience so far.

This post is the definitive collection of my answers to such questions (which may evolve over time).
How do I become a data scientist?
It depends on your situation. Before we get into it, have you thought about why you want to become a data scientist? Hmm&amp;hellip; Not really. Why should I become a data scientist?</description></item><item><title>My 10-step path to becoming a remote data scientist with Automattic</title><link>https://yanirseroussi.com/2017/07/29/my-10-step-path-to-becoming-a-remote-data-scientist-with-automattic/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jul 2017 05:39:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yanirseroussi.com/2017/07/29/my-10-step-path-to-becoming-a-remote-data-scientist-with-automattic/</guid><description>About two years ago, I read the book The Year without Pants, which describes the author&amp;rsquo;s experience leading a team at Automattic (the company behind WordPress.com, among other products). Automattic is a fully-distributed company, which means that all of its employees work remotely (hence pants are optional). While the book discusses some of the challenges of working remotely, the author&amp;rsquo;s general experience was very positive. A few months after reading the book, I decided to look for a full-time position after a period of independent work.</description></item></channel></rss>
