I suppose other Kaggle beginners may find it useful.
My first steps when working on a new competition are:
Read all the instructions carefully to understand the problem. One important thing to look at is what measure is being optimised. For example, minimising the mean absolute error (MAE) may require a different approach from minimising the mean square error (MSE).</description></item></channel></rss>
