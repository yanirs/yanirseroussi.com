Automattic is a fully-distributed company, which means that all of its employees work remotely (hence pants are optional). While the book discusses some of the challenges of working remotely, the author&amp;rsquo;s general experience was very positive. A few months after reading the book, I decided to look for a full-time position after a period of independent work.</description></item><item><title>Ask Why! Finding motives, causes, and purpose in data science</title><link>https://yanirs.github.io/yanirseroussi.com/2016/09/19/ask-why-finding-motives-causes-and-purpose-in-data-science/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Sep 2016 21:28:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yanirs.github.io/yanirseroussi.com/2016/09/19/ask-why-finding-motives-causes-and-purpose-in-data-science/</guid><description>Some people equate predictive modelling with data science, thinking that mastering various machine learning techniques is the key that unlocks the mysteries of the field. However, there is much more to data science than the What and How of predictive modelling. I recently gave a talk where I argued the importance of asking Why, touching on three different topics: stakeholder motives, cause-and-effect relationships, and finding a sense of purpose. A video of the talk is available below.</description></item><item><title>The joys of offline data collection</title><link>https://yanirs.github.io/yanirseroussi.com/2016/01/24/the-joys-of-offline-data-collection/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Jan 2016 00:32:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yanirs.github.io/yanirseroussi.com/2016/01/24/the-joys-of-offline-data-collection/</guid><description>Many modern data scientists don&amp;rsquo;t get to experience data collection in the offline world. Recently, I spent a month sailing down the northern Great Barrier Reef, collecting data for the Reef Life Survey project. In addition to being a great diving experience, the trip helped me obtain general insights on data collection and machine learning, which are shared in this article.
The Reef Life Survey project Reef Life Survey (RLS) is a citizen scientist project, led by a team from the University of Tasmania.</description></item><item><title>The long road to a lifestyle business</title><link>https://yanirs.github.io/yanirseroussi.com/2015/03/22/the-long-road-to-a-lifestyle-business/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Mar 2015 09:43:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yanirs.github.io/yanirseroussi.com/2015/03/22/the-long-road-to-a-lifestyle-business/</guid><description>Almost a year ago, I left my last full-time job and decided to set on an independent path that includes data science consulting and work on my own projects. The ultimate goal is not to have to sell my time for money by generating enough passive income to live comfortably. My five main areas of focus are – in no particular order – personal branding &amp;amp; networking, data science contracting, Bandcamp Recommender, Price Dingo, and marine conservation.</description></item></channel></rss>
