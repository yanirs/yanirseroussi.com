The main lesson: You get what you pay for. Despite some improvements, Parse remains very unreliable, and any time saved by using their APIs and SDKs tends to be offset by having to work around the restrictions of their sandboxed environment. This post details some of the issues I faced and the transition away from the service.</description></item><item><title>Automating Parse.com bulk data imports</title><link>https://yanirs.github.io/yanirseroussi.com/2015/01/15/automating-parse-com-bulk-data-imports/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2015 04:41:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yanirs.github.io/yanirseroussi.com/2015/01/15/automating-parse-com-bulk-data-imports/</guid><description>Parse is a great backend-as-a-service (BaaS) product. It removes much of the hassle involved in backend devops with its web hosting service, SDKs for all the major mobile platforms, and a generous free tier. Parse does have its share of flaws, including various reliability issues (which seem to be getting rarer), and limitations on what you can do (which is reasonable price to pay for working within a sandboxed environment). One such limitation is the lack of APIs to perform bulk data imports.</description></item></channel></rss>
