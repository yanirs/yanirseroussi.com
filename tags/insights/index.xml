However, there is much more to data science than the What and How of predictive modelling. I recently gave a talk where I argued the importance of asking Why, touching on three different topics: stakeholder motives, cause-and-effect relationships, and finding a sense of purpose. A video of the talk is available below.</description></item><item><title>Diving deeper into causality: Pearl, Kleinberg, Hill, and untested assumptions</title><link>https://yanirs.github.io/yanirseroussi.com/2016/05/15/diving-deeper-into-causality-pearl-kleinberg-hill-and-untested-assumptions/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 May 2016 19:57:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yanirs.github.io/yanirseroussi.com/2016/05/15/diving-deeper-into-causality-pearl-kleinberg-hill-and-untested-assumptions/</guid><description>Background: I have previously written about the need for real insights that address the why behind events, not only the what and how. This was followed by a fairly popular post on causality, which was heavily influenced by Samantha Kleinberg's book Why: A Guide to Finding and Using Causes. This post continues my exploration of the field, and is primarily based on Kleinberg's previous book: Causality, Probability, and Time.
The study of causality and causal inference is central to science in general and data science in particular.</description></item><item><title>Why you should stop worrying about deep learning and deepen your understanding of causality instead</title><link>https://yanirs.github.io/yanirseroussi.com/2016/02/14/why-you-should-stop-worrying-about-deep-learning-and-deepen-your-understanding-of-causality-instead/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Feb 2016 11:04:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yanirs.github.io/yanirseroussi.com/2016/02/14/why-you-should-stop-worrying-about-deep-learning-and-deepen-your-understanding-of-causality-instead/</guid><description>Everywhere you go these days, you hear about deep learning&amp;rsquo;s impressive advancements. New deep learning libraries, tools, and products get announced on a regular basis, making the average data scientist feel like they&amp;rsquo;re missing out if they don&amp;rsquo;t hop on the deep learning bandwagon. However, as Kamil Bartocha put it in his post The Inconvenient Truth About Data Science, 95% of tasks do not require deep learning. This is obviously a made up number, but it&amp;rsquo;s probably an accurate representation of the everyday reality of many data scientists.</description></item><item><title>This holiday season, give me real insights</title><link>https://yanirs.github.io/yanirseroussi.com/2015/12/08/this-holiday-season-give-me-real-insights/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Dec 2015 06:57:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yanirs.github.io/yanirseroussi.com/2015/12/08/this-holiday-season-give-me-real-insights/</guid><description>Merriam-Webster defines an insight as an understanding of the true nature of something. Many companies seem to define an insight as any piece of data or information, which I would call a pseudo-insight. This post surveys some examples of pseudo-insights, and discusses how these can be built upon to provide real insights.
