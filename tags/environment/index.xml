I found that using auto-generated flashcards with an increasing level of difficulty is a good way to memorise marine species. Since publishing that post, I have improved the flashcards and built a tool for exploring the aggregate survey data. Both tools are now publicly available on the RLS website.</description></item><item><title>The joys of offline data collection</title><link>https://yanirs.github.io/yanirseroussi.com/2016/01/24/the-joys-of-offline-data-collection/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Jan 2016 00:32:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yanirs.github.io/yanirseroussi.com/2016/01/24/the-joys-of-offline-data-collection/</guid><description>Many modern data scientists don&amp;rsquo;t get to experience data collection in the offline world. Recently, I spent a month sailing down the northern Great Barrier Reef, collecting data for the Reef Life Survey project. In addition to being a great diving experience, the trip helped me obtain general insights on data collection and machine learning, which are shared in this article.
The Reef Life Survey project Reef Life Survey (RLS) is a citizen scientist project, led by a team from the University of Tasmania.</description></item><item><title>My divestment from fossil fuels</title><link>https://yanirs.github.io/yanirseroussi.com/2015/04/24/my-divestment-from-fossil-fuels/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2015 00:19:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yanirs.github.io/yanirseroussi.com/2015/04/24/my-divestment-from-fossil-fuels/</guid><description>This post covers recent choices I've made to reduce my exposure to fossil fuels, including practical steps that can be taken by Australians and generally applicable lessons. I recently read Naomi Klein&amp;rsquo;s This Changes Everything, which deeply influenced me. The book describes how the world has been dragging its feet when it comes to reducing carbon emissions, and how we are coming very close to a point where climate change is likely to spin out of control.</description></item></channel></rss>
